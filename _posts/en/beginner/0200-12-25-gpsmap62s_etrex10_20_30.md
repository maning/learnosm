Using Garmin GPSmap 62s
==============================


In the Beginner OpenStreetMap guide, you have learned what GPS is and
how it works in general. However, the guide is limited to the old series
Garmin GPS (**eTrex vista HCX/60CSx**) with the old menu interface. Since
the series has been discontinued or is no longer manufactured, Garmin
GPS available in the market in general are **eTrex 10/20/30**, **GPSMAP 62s**,
and **Oregon**,  that supports use of the touch screen. The GPS functions
remain the same but the menu interface for Garmin devices have been
updated.

We will discuss how to set up your Garmin GPS device ready for data
collection. We are using the Garmin GPSMAP 62s in this guide, this is
also useful other Garmin GPS device with the same menu interface.

Choose a good GPS
-----------------------

The most popular Garmin GPS right now is the Garmin GPSMAP 62s and eTrex
series (10/20/30). We do not recommend using a GPS that has a touch
screen like the Garmin Oregon because the touch screen sensor is less
responsive, it is quite vulnerable to damage and, repair is expensive.

For mapping in forested areas or remote areas with rugged terrain,
Garmin 62s is a good choice, because of its sturdy body casing, metal
loop, and an external helix GPS antenna that allows for greater signal
reception. Compared to newer models, Garmin 62s provides faster
satellite fix and better precision on forested areas but is a bit slower
to obtain a fix on open field as compared to other models that supports
both Glonass and GPS satellites. User interface navigation is faster as
compared to the Etrex series due to better hardware.

For urban areas, eTrex 10/20/30 series could be an option. eTrex
10/20/30 has the ability to capture satellite signals from Russia's
GLONASS satellite so it's time to lock-in to your position is quicker.
It is also small and handy. The disadvantage is that these devices are
not as tough as the GPSMAP 62s, and has no external antenna. The eTrex
10 model on the other hand, does not have external memory and can not
display a digital map.

The GPS your purchased, includes several accessories, such as :

1. Cable data
2. CD Driver
3. Warranty Card
4. Memory card type microSD (for some types of GPS)  

The batteries used are AA Alkaline. You can also use rechargeable NiMH
AA batteries; as well as Lithium AA.

Alkaline batteries are however discouraged if you will be using the GPS
unit on cold temperatures. NiMH and Lithium batteries lasts longer when
operating on extremely cold temperatures.

Default Setting
---------------------

Before changing the default setting, make sure you are familiar with the
functions of the buttons below. For those of you who have ever used a
Garmin 60CSx you should not have a problem, because the device has the
similar button layout.

![GPSMap 62s buttons][]

GPSMap 62s button functions:

1. Zoom in (to map page)
2. Zoom out (to map page)
3. Search waypoint
4. Navigation menu or to pan the map on the map page
5. Switch page
6. Create a new waypoint
7. Exit or cancel
8. To confirm the selection
9. Sub-menu
10. Press about 3 seconds to turn on / off GPS devices, press 1 second
    to see the time display, set light screen, satellite power, and the
    remaining battery.

### GPS System settings

-   Access **Setup** menu on the **Main** menu using the **Page** button. Then enter
    to **System**.

![Main menu][] ![Setup menu][]

The **System** menu has the following options:

**GPS**: how to manage the GPS sensor works.

-  **Normal** - Better to save your battery. The device captures only the 
   signals from the GPS satellites. But your position accuracy sometimes 
   less accurate (about 10-30 meters)

-  **WAAS/EGNOS** - WAAS stands for Wide Area Augmentation System, while 
   EGNOS stands for Euro Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service. There are 
   generally provided by the GPS with an accuracy of \~15 meters. WAAS/EGNOS 
   is a  system satellites and ground stations that provide GPS signal
   corrections, giving you a better position accuracy (to less than 3
   meters). If you choose the mode WAAS / EGNOS, you will get better
   accuracy, but make sure you have backup battery, because it consumes
   more power.

![WAAS][]

-  **Demo Mode** - Mode to show how GPS works capture satellite signals 
   and decide your position in simulation mode (rather than actual position).

![Demo mode][]
 
-   **Language**: You can choose language you want to use.
-   **Battery Type**: To optimize power usage, choose to the type of battery
    you actually use in the your device (default: Alkaline).
-   **Interface**: When GPS is connected to your computer, you can choose
    this option. We recommend that you select "Garmin Serial" or "Mass
    Storage" to be able to access your waypoint and track files because
    your GPS will be read as a flash disk.

### Units Settings

Access the menu **Setup \> System \> Units** to  manage your preferred
display units. For example, in meter, feet, and others.

![Main menu, Units][] ![Units settings][]

### Time Settings

Access the menu **Setup \> System \> Time**. You can manage time format (12
hours or 24 hours) and your time zone.

### Coordinate System Settings

You choose menu **Setup \> System \> Position Format**. You can manage
position format (decimal degree, decimal minutes degree, second minutes
degree), datum (standard WGS 84) and projection (standard WGS 84).

![Coordinate system settings][]

### Page Settings

Access the menu Setup **\> System \> Page Sequences**. You remember about
function Pages button? You can manage which pages you use often, so you
do need to do a lot of button pressing to access the page function. You
can press the Page button several times to page you want access. You can
add page function with select **Add Page** then select function such as:
**Satellite** (to view the status satellite, position, and accuracy), **Trip
Computer** (to view details your trip), **Map** (to view maps).

![Page settings][]

### Tracks Settings

Access the menu **Setup \> System \> Tracks**. Do you remember the track
function? Tracks can record your track ride, it is very useful for
mapping the road. In the menu there are a few settings such as:

![Track settings][]

**Track Log**

1. **Do Not Record** – stop recording the track, choose this setting
   every time you finish mapping.
2. **Record, Do Not Show On Map** – track is recorded, but no track trail
   is displayed on the map.
3. **Record, Show on Map** – track is recorded, track trail will be
   visible on the map. Always choose the setting before you start
   mapping.

**Record Method**

1. **Distance** – track is recorded based on a user defined distance range.
2. **Time** – track is recorded based on a user defined time range.
3. **Auto** – automatic track recording (use this option).

**Recording Interval**
This setting defines how often the GPS will record your track. For OSM
editing, you should set it to the **Most often** to produce a line of
track that is smooth and tidy but, this will consume more battery. If
**Least often** is used, recording will be very sparse and, the track
produced will appear broken.

1. **Most often** – track recording at any time as often as possible
2. **More often** – track recording done as often as possible
3. **Normal** – track recording at normal
4. **Less often** – track recording not at any time (below normally)
5. **Least often** – track recording infrequently

We recommend you use the **Most often** option to get as much recording as
possible.

**Auto Archive**

1. **When Full**: automatically saves your track when device is running
   out of storage.
2. **Daily**:  will save your track once a day
3. **Weekly**: will save your track every week.

**Color** - You can change display line color on track maps.

Start using GPS
-------------------

-  Before you go into the field to mapping, make sure Track Log in a
   state **Do Not Record**.
-  Make sure you do reset data, so that track and waypoint from
   previous surveys  are not combined with the track and waypoint you
   create. To do this, access the menu **Setup \> System \> Reset**.
-  Choose, **Reset Trip Data \> Yes. Delete All Waypoints \> Yes. Clear
   Current Track \> Yes**.

![Resetting previous trip data][]

-  Before starting the survey, activate **Track Log** option. Check the
   satellite status and accuracy from the **Main menu \> Satellites**. You can
   start your survey once you get maximum accuracy (3-5 meters), with
   number of satellite minimum 8 satellite, and your coordinate position
   has appeared on the map. 

![Satellite page][]

-  Before you walk, activate **Track Log** (check track settings).

-  After Track Log activate, you can go survey. If you find an object
   you want to mark, you can press the **Mark** button and then click **OK**.

Download your tracks and waypoints 
---------------------------------------

-  Once you have completed the survey, you can connect the GPS to your
   computer (using a regular data cable, data cable such as a camera). Once
   you connect your GPS to the computer with the data cable, then your
   computer will form a new hard drive. Usually formed two hard drives,
   with the name "Removable Disk".

![Connecting the GPS to the computer (MS-Windows)][]

In this example, the computer detected two new disks, the 
“Removable Disk (G:)” and ”Removable Disk (H:)”  

![Disk G][] ![Disk H][]

-  Select the disk with fewer folder
   (containing only 4 folder), so select "Removable Disk (G :)". Then on
   the hard drive which contains many folder, find the folder Garmin. Why?
   Because the folder saved Tracks and Waypoints. Here is the contents of
   the folder "Garmin". In this Garmin folder, find the folder GPX.  

![GPX folder][]

-  Here is the content of GPX folder. In this GPX folder, you can simply
   copy the GPX file you want to your computer.

![Saved tracks and waypoints][]

-  To get your WAYPOINT data, copy file “Waypoints.....”
-  To get your TRACK data, copy file “Track.....”
-  If you feel you do not keep a track (in other words you forget to
   keep your track), you can get your files TRACK in folder Current . Here
   is the contents of the folder Current.

![current.gpx file][]

-  File “Current.gpx” is a track file that you forget to save. Copy this
   file as well.
